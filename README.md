# URL shortener microservice

This is the [URL Shortener microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/url-shortener-microservice) required for the Backend certification from FreeCodeCamp.

It provides a short url for the submitted http or https url.

The project was developed from the Javascript [boilerplate repo](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/boilerplate-project-urlshortener/) from FCC but in Typescript.

Endpoints:

* / provides a  form to submit a url and provides a short_url that can be used in the second endpoint.
* /api/shorturl/short_url redirects to the original url.

The project was submitted to FCC [as a replit](https://replit.com/@PRBorges/URLShortener-FCC). It should be live at [https://URLShortener-FCC.prborges.repl.co](https://URLShortener-FCC.prborges.repl.co).
